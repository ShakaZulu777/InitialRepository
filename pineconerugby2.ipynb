This, coupled with an ever-growing problem of spectator behaviour, makes your coaching job a lot harder.\\n\\nRecruiting volunteers is one of the biggest challenges for any junior Rugby League club. You, as a coach have potential volunteers from every child in your team.\\n\\nParent engagement is the key to alleviating many problems you will have as a coach. By engaging and communicating effectively with the parents of your team you will be able to reduce the conflict between you and parents as well as improve spectator behaviour on the sidelines. This will also provide you with opportunity to recruit some parents as volunteers within your team and make your job a lot easier.\\n\\nNot only will volunteers give you some extra coaching or administration help, they will also gain an understanding of the time and effort you are putting in and thus less likely to criticise you, the club, or game officials.\\n\\nThere are 3 steps to effective parent engagement\\n\\n1.\\n\\n2. 3.\\n\\nHave a preseason orientation meeting for parents Provide volunteering opportunities for parents Communication\\n\\nThe key to effective engagement of parents primarily begins with an orientation meeting that can be done in the form of the first training session or a team BBQ for everyone to get to know each other.\\n\\n66\\n\\n8 Steps to an Effective Parent Orientation Meeting\\n\\nStep 1 Introduce yourself and your coaching staff\\n\\nIntroduce yourself to the parents by providing a little background about yourself within the sport and outside the sport (so they see you as a coach and a real person). Touch on your experience in the sport, weather you have coached before, and why you are coaching. Have each of your coaching staff do the same.\\n\\n8 Steps to an Effective Parent Orientation Meeting\\n\\n1 Introduce yourself and your\\n\\ncoaching staff\\n\\nStep 2 Explain your coaching philosophy\\n\\n2 Explain your coaching\\n\\nphilosophy\\n\\nThis is a perfect time to explain to your parents what you want to achieve from coaching their children and how you expect everyone involved to approach the sport. You should explain your own philosophy but really emphasise that kids sport is about skill development and fun, it’s not about winning.\\n\\n3 Explain your season plan\\n\\n4 Explain safety and any\\n\\nmodified rules\\n\\n5 Discuss the coach, player, and\\n\\nStep 3 Explain your season plan\\n\\nparent code of conducts\\n\\n6 Explain your team rules\\n\\nYou can use this section to explain your season goals and how you will go about reaching them as well as the specifics of your program. When talking about specifics you can touch on:\\n\\n7 Volunteer opportunities\\n\\n8 Question & Answer\\n\\nWhen the season starts and finishes The times and places for training and\\n\\ngames\\n\\nThe equipment,\\n\\nif any, needed at\\n\\nof your training is not about winning games. Explain that your training will focus on skill development and fun enjoyable activities.\\n\\ntraining and games\\n\\nWhen discussing season goals give an overview of what you will be doing at training and what you want the players to learn. You should ensure that you explain that the focus\\n\\nExplain your plan for equal involvement. Explain to the parents what system you have for ensuring all players get the same amount of game time, involvement etc. This can help alleviate conflict later.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 2\\n\\n67\\n\\nStep 4 Explain safety and any modified rules\\n\\nUse this time to explain to parents any modified rules of the game at that age group (if you don’t know, check yourself). Many parents wont know the modified rules of the game and this can create conflict towards match officials.\\n\\nAlso use this time to explain the safety aspects of the game for their children in junior rugby league like the NRL Safeplay Code. If possible provide parents with documentation on the rule differences and the NRL Safeplay Code. Also explain the first aid system at the club and what care is available to their kids.\\n\\ntechniques you use at training. If you have open communication about these rules with the parents it will help avoid conflict later on. If the parents know about and agree with you on these rules then they are much easier to enforce. You can also retouch on how you plan to actively involve all players in the team. You may explain how you will rotate players on the bench or how you plan on having players in different positions. Conflict can arise later on if parents don’t think their child is getting a fair go. If you have explained your system of fairness, stick to it, you can avoid this conflict altogether.\\n\\nStep 5 Discuss the player, coach, & parent codes of conduct\\n\\nDiscuss with the parents the NRL codes of conduct for each group of people. Explain to them that your not signalling them out but these codes outline what is acceptable behaviour in the sport and what is not.\\n\\nThis is a good opportunity to talk about sideline behaviour on the weekends. You can explain that the kids are there to have fun and enjoy the game. Explain that there are no problems with parents encouraging from the sideline but there should be no yelling or abuse towards the team, the opposition, or the officials. Explain that these people are vital to the game continuing to run and even though they may feel frustrated, they should only encourage the team..\\n\\nStep 7 Volunteering Opportunities\\n\\nIn this part of the initial meeting you can also explain the opportunities for parents to volunteer within the team and within the club. Even if you already have a coaching staff, you can explain to parents that you always need extra hands at training if anyone wishes to help out. You can also explain to parents the volunteering opportunities within the club itself as well and that anyone is interested you can help facilitate this. Volunteering opportunities could be anything from scoring, fundraising, BBQ & canteen, trainers, or equipment managers. If you can get a parent to volunteer to do a small job then you are more likely to encourage them to take bigger roles in the future.:\\n\\nStep 6 Explain your team rules\\n\\nStep 8 Question & Answer\\n\\nYou can explain any team rules here that you specifically use. Such as discipline\\n\\nAllow parents the opportunity to ask any questions and try to give the best answers you can.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 2\\n\\n68\\n\\nCommunication with Parents Communication with your parents is one key to avoiding conflict and successfully engaging parents. Some quick tips for communicating with parents are:\\n\\nTips for Parent & Officials Sport should be fun\\n\\n\\n\\nInvite parents to the end of training or end of game talk to the players. This way you can pass on information directly to them.\\n\\nYour own agenda is not\\n\\nyour child’s\\n\\n\\n\\nTake the time to communicate with each parent individually. Don’t always talk to them in a group. If you get to know them away from football, there is less likelihood for conflict later.\\n\\nEmphasis the process of execution of skills instead of results and trophies\\n\\nCommunication Ideas: SMS & Email lists Season calendar Match reports by email and website Monthly newsletter Individual feedback Meetings Social Events Volunteering opportunities Having parents involved as volunteers in your team can help them better understand your job and its difficulties and provide you with extra hands throughout the season. Some volunteer positions you can have could include:\\n\\nYou are a role model to your children. You should show composure on the sideline so your children learn positive behaviours\\n\\nRefrain from game time coaching. Just let them play\\n\\nAsk the right questions. Your first question after a game should be “did you have fun” not “did you win”\\n\\nTeam manager Trainers First Aid Officers Assistant Coaches Social Committee Additional helpers at training\\n\\nCheers all team\\n\\nmembers positively\\n\\nDon’t criticise your\\n\\nteam, the opposition, or match officials.\\n\\nHaving parents involved in this capacity will make your job easier and will provide the parents with a better understanding of what goes on. This understanding together with good communication will help keep parents informed and happy.\\n\\nSummarise this information in an introduction letter to reinforce the messages\\n\\nKeep everything in\\n\\nperspective; remember that the focus of children’s sport is to create an opportunity for fun and growth.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 2\\n\\n69\\n\\nGROUP MANAGEMENT Group Management Skills for Junior Coaches\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 3\\n\\nCoaching Kids Sport\\n\\nCoaching kids sporting teams is a wonderful way to impart your knowledge back on younger generations. However, we find that it is becoming increasingly difficult to control kids behaviours, which ultimately impacts on a junior coaches ability to pass on this knowledge. This document will hopefully provide you with some practical group management skills that may help you as a junior coach to foster fun, enjoyment, development, and total involvement philosophies into your training sessions.\\n\\nCoaches Checklist\\n\\nAll junior coaches should have the following to manage their group more effectively.\\n\\nWhistle\\n\\nFootballs\\n\\nTraining Equipment\\n\\nVariety of Activities\\n\\nPlanned Sessions\\n\\nVolunteer Helpers –\\n\\nPlanning to Coach Kids\\n\\ntrainers, managers, & parent helpers\\n\\nAs a junior coach you should look for your training sessions to involve a number of the following characteristics.\\n\\n“Penalties” or “time\\n\\nout” systems to control behaviour\\n\\nPromotion of fun, teamwork and cooperation Acknowledge individual differences and cater for all\\n\\nabilities Introduce one thing at a time to avoid confusion\\n\\nUse a variety of activities with maximum participation Allow time for skills to develop Listen to what children have to say Be positive and provide good feedback\\n\\nKids are more likely to misbehave if they are bored or are not involved. Training sessions that promote the constant involvement will help control behavior of your group\\n\\n70\\n\\nWhat do you need in a Training Session Whistle Skills\\n\\nColour Co-ordinate Marker’s\\n\\nA whistle is the best way to control behaviour in your team as it can grab every ones attention instantly with one loud blow. This can be achieved by establishing what the whistle means through a game of “freeze” with the group. Have everyone run around inside a grid and when the whistle is blown loud, they have to stop and look at you quietly with their hands on their head. This will establish a “stop, look, and listen” tool for you. Only blow the whistle once, multiple whistles will loose its value.\\n\\nA whistle is one of the important group management tools for coaches\\n\\nTraining Equipment\\n\\nSome times kids may be confused by the layout of an activity or drill. This can be easily averted by colour coordinating cones in your activities and using them in combination with agility poles etc. A simple example of this would to be a relay with 4 lines using two markers per team. Each teams.\\n\\nMaximum Participation Activities\\n\\nKids are very active and always looking to have fun. When they are not involved or having fun, it’s usually when they start to misbehave to entertain themselves. Using maximum participation activities will reduce your risk of misbehaviour because there is no time for the kids to create trouble. This can be achieved by:\\n\\nTraining equipment is essential to helping you manage your group. All coaches need to realise that if you only have two footballs per team and a few cones you are limited in what you can do. Some important equipment could include:\\n\\nFootballs – As many as possible so that you are able to do activities that include everyone at once.\\n\\nMarkers – about 20 – 30 should be enough and preferably in 4 – 5 different colours.\\n\\nAgility poles – apart form agility, these can help kids to look up when doing an activity. If they are running around a marker, they are looking at the ground. If it’s around a pole or tackle bag, they are looking up.\\n\\nIncrease the number of repetitions in the drill. This means that instead of having one line doing the activity with 12 kids, have 4 lines of 3 kids. This will reduce the downtime, while increasing the amount of repetitions they do and help improve their skill levels.\\n\\nUsing Skill Biased Game to teach skills and practice rather than refined drills or ball work. An example of this could be playing a Skill Biased Game of 6 v 6 rather than one team of 12 doing ball work unopposed.\\n\\nInvolving parents or helpers to assist with activities so you can better manage the group.\\n\\nColoured Bibs – when doing activities in teams, you can use a set of coloured bibs to clearly define the two teams.\\n\\nFor Rugby League Training Equipment www.playnrl.com\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 3\\n\\n71\\n\\nBehaviour Management Behaviour management is one of the hardest aspects of being a junior coach. If you can achieve this it will ensure your job is a lot easier and less stressful. Being a positive role model will help your players develop rugby league and life skills\\n\\nCauses of Misbehaviour\\n\\nWell Structured Sessions\\n\\nA well organized and structured session will assist in controlling a group’s behavior. These include:\\n\\nMisbehaviour is a very common theme in junior training sessions. It’s important to understand why this happens and how we can fix it:\\n\\nPlanning your sessions\\n\\nArrive early and set up equipment\\n\\nNot enough equipment for the amount\\n\\nof kids in the group\\n\\nThe coach showing a lack of interest\\n\\nBring the group in and sit down to explain the session. This is also good to help regroup after pre session socializing\\n\\nand supervision\\n\\nToo much talking from the coach\\n\\nMake the warm up an active fun game\\n\\nActivities that run too long\\n\\nMinimize down time and waiting\\n\\nKids waiting in long lines for a turn\\n\\nBoring, non challenging activities\\n\\nUnclear rules and expectations\\n\\nHave a strategy to move between activities. E.g. having the group form a straight line and follow you to the next activity is great.\\n\\nStrategies to Manage Behaviour\\n\\nPARENT INVOLVEMENT\\n\\nTIME OUTS\\n\\nPOSITIVE REINFORCEMENT\\n\\nYou can involve parents a number of ways to manage behavior. These include:\\n\\nAsking parents to attend\\n\\nand watch sessions\\n\\nAsking parents to help\\n\\nmanage activities\\n\\nIf you have ongoing problems with the child, talk to the parents, as they may not know\\n\\nA “time out” involves withdrawing a misbehav- ing child from the activ- ity and sitting them out in a place that you can still supervise them. If parents attend training, tell them about the “time out” sys- tem and area. If they see their child in that area, they are welcome to come over and talk to the child\\n\\nPraise and encourage- ment can be some of the best motivational tools for a junior coach. This can help a child develop self confidence as well as encourage the child to try harder in hope of re- ceiving recognition from a role model or someone they look up to, like you the coach.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 3\\n\\n72\\n\\nCommunication D.E.P.E Method\\n\\nThe D.E.P.E method of coaching is important because it will help reduce the amount of time spent talking before an activity and prevent boredom in the group. The D.E.P.E method is:\\n\\nDemonstrate: demonstrate yourself or have a group of kids demonstrate the skill or activity, this should be done hand in hand with step two\\n\\nPenalties & Reward’s\\n\\nAll coaches need to create a penalty and reward system to encourage good behaviour and discourage bad behaviour. The penalties and rewards need to be immediate to have the desired effect.\\n\\nExplain: during the demonstration, verbally explain the\\n\\nactivity & what the outcome will be\\n\\nPenalties\\n\\nParticipation: allow the group attempt the activity without\\n\\nSitting in a time out\\n\\nstopping the group to often to talk.\\n\\nYour team looses\\n\\nEvaluate:\\n\\nidentify skill faults and give feedback individually without stopping the whole activity, unless its for the group.\\n\\nCommunication Tips\\n\\nBe positive and don’t be afraid to have a laugh\\n\\npossession in a game situation\\n\\nPlay a fun game and sit out the misbehaving player/s.\\n\\nMake eye contact when talking to someone\\n\\nAsk questions & listen intently to player’s responses\\n\\nRewards\\n\\nrather than tell them what to do.\\n\\nBe clear and concise when giving feedback\\n\\nNon verbal communication such as frowning, laughing,\\n\\nsmiling, and body position is important\\n\\nPraise positive behaviour as well as disapprove of\\n\\nnegative behaviour.\\n\\nAll coaches need to create a penalty and reward system to encourage good behaviour and discourage bad behaviour. The penalties and rewards need to be immediate to have the desired effect.\\n\\nDiscipline doesn’t mean being negative or nasty, it just means that you enforce the rules of the group\\n\\nDiscipline with Junior Teams\\n\\nIt’s important to have some form of discipline within your group. This doesn’t mean that you need to be a nasty or negative coach, it just mean you need to have boundaries set for the group. If they or any individual break the rules that have been set then you need to enforce the pre-determined penalties. E.g. if a player breaks a rule you need to enforce the penalty otherwise the other players will see there has been no penalty and will push the boundaries as well. Avoid empty threats, as kids will see right through you.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 2\\n\\n73\\n\\nSKILL BIASED GAMES Teaching Rugby League through Skill Biased training games\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\nWhat is a Skill Biased Game?\\n\\nWhat Are the Benefits of Skill Biased Games?\\n\\nA skill biased game is a training aid designed to teach players an aspect of rugby league while practicing it in a game based situation. It can also provide a team with the same benefit of development.\\n\\nThe reasoning behind a skill biased game is to modify the rules and situations of normal rugby league to suit what you are trying to teach or practice. The games can be used for a variety of training, which could include fun skill based games for mini league players to more situational opposed games for junior international players.\\n\\nIn the following pages we will set out everything you need to know to create your own skill biased game and start using them in your training sessions. These Skill Biased Games can be:\\n\\nSkill Biased Game can benefit you as a coach through: Increased player participation\\n\\nIncreased core skill\\n\\nrepetition within a game situation\\n\\nMore core skills such as passing and tackling can be attempted providing repetition for your players\\n\\nImproved problem\\n\\nsolving skills\\n\\nSkill games\\n\\nImproved\\n\\nFun games\\n\\ncommunication skills Variety in your training\\n\\nConditioning games\\n\\nTeamwork games\\n\\nSituational games\\n\\nProblem solving games\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\n74\\n\\nHow is a Skill Biased Game Different from a Training Drill? The main difference between drills and Skill Biased Game is that a skill biased game encourages players to practice skills in an environment that mimics segments of the whole game on the weekend. There are 3 different ways you can teach skills in the core of your training session. They are:\\n\\nClosed Drill: This would be simple drills that allow players to practice the skill without much\\n\\ndistraction. This could include passing in pairs or stationary tackling\\n\\nOpen Drill: These are activities that allow players to practice skills and situations but are not\\n\\nin a game setting. This could include a simple 2 v 1 drill or passing in lines\\n\\nSkill Biased Game: As we found out earlier, Skill Biased Game are modified games of rugby\\n\\nleague. These modifications need to be made to practice a certain skill or situation\\n\\nClosed Drill\\n\\nIntroduce new skill Minimal pressure Stable Environment\\n\\nExamples Skill Relays 4 Corners Line Passing\\n\\nOpen Drill\\n\\nPractice Skills Pressure Unstable Environment\\n\\nExamples 10 Pass Scramble Bull Rush\\n\\nSkill Biased Game\\n\\nGames of Rugby League, whereby the rules are modified by the coach to promote the use of a skill.\\n\\nHow to use Skill Biased Games in a Training Session You can use Skill Biased Game 2 ways. The first way would involve building towards a skill biased game by progressing through Closed Drill and Open Drill and using the Skill Biased Game as a way to practice the skill. The other way is to start with the Skill Biased Game, take them into a refining drill, and then back into a Skill Biased Game to practice those skills.\\n\\nPROGRESSION\\n\\nGAME - PRACTICE - GAME\\n\\nWarm Up Closed Drill Open Drill Skill Biased Game Cool Down\\n\\nWarm Up Skill Biased Game Open Drill Skill Biased Game\\n\\nCool Down\\n\\nBuilding Session: This way of training is a building block. It starts with a breakdown and practice of a skill or team play then progresses to a basic open drill. Once players have practiced the skill and completed the skill in a controlled activity you then move to Skill Biased Game.\\n\\nGame - Practice - Game: This way of structuring your session is a step forward from the last. It involves starting with a skill biased game, identifying a skill that needs improvement, conducting a refined drill on that skill, and then coming back to the game. The outcome should see players concentrate on completing the skill better the second time around.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\n75\\n\\nTypes of Skill Biased Games\\n\\nSKILL GAMES\\n\\nFUN GAMES\\n\\nThese are games based around trying like ball individual skills to handling, passing, tackling etc.\\n\\nimprove\\n\\nThese are games that are purely designed for fun and enjoyment. They involve skills of rugby league in a fun way.\\n\\nCONDITIONING GAMES\\n\\nOPPOSED TEAMWORK GAMES\\n\\nRather than use traditional conditioning, try and incorporate a game. These types of games usually involve making fields bigger, reducing player numbers, or making games continuous.\\n\\nThese are games that are designed to improve team play. They are usually situational based and are opposed. The aim is to break down team play and practice individual sections of attack or defence.\\n\\nMINI / MOD GAMES\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL GAMES\\n\\nGames for mini mod ages need to be more skill related and fun. The more kids can practice in a game environment the better.\\n\\nGames for international ages can be fun but they also need to have games that are teamwork based and situational based.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\n76\\n\\nSkill Biased Games Matrix\\n\\nGAME OUTCOMES What do you want your team or players to learn? Is it skill, teamwork, fun, or conditioning based? Is it attack or defence based?\\n\\nFIELD SIZE What is the length and width of your field?\\n\\nPLAYERS PER TEAM How many players on each team in the game?\\n\\nSTOPPING PLAY Highlight how a player is stopped in the game\\n\\nTouch Tackle Grab Other\\n\\nRESTARTING PLAY Highlight how a player restarts the game after a stop\\n\\nPlay the Ball Tap Restart Elbows & Knees Roll over & PTB\\n\\nRULE CHANGES What are the rule changes in your game that differ from normal Rugby League?

Or a game that starts in a situation on the field?\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\n77\\n\\nSkill Biased Games Matrix Explained\\n\\nWhat is your game outcome? In this stage you must state what it is you want to achieve from your game. An example of this could be that you identified your team was deficient in marker defence during weekend games. The outcome of your session could be that you want to teach a new marker defence system or practice an existing one with the goal of improving communication. Your outcome also needs to be:\\n\\nSkill, teamwork, conditioning, or fun based Attack or defence based Individual skill or team skill based\\n\\nWhat is the size of your field? All you have to do here is explain your field size. What is the length and width? This will depend on your game outcome e.g. if you are designing a conditioning game your field will be large. If you are designing a skill game around the ruck area, it will be narrow.\\n\\nHow many players per team? Simply how many players per team. Most games will have 2 teams. Teams can be even numbers or can be uneven to help the attack or defence. Having fewer defenders will promote attacking games and vice versa\\n\\nHow is play stopped? How to you stop a player? In normal rugby league you are tackled, in a Skill Biased Game you can modify this to variations of tackle and touch. This could include\\n\\nTackle Grab\\n\\nTouch Variations\\n\\nHow is play restarted? Play is normally restarted with a play the ball. You can restart with:\\n\\nPlay the ball Tap\\n\\nRoll over on back before playing the ball Hit elbows and knees before playing the ball\\n\\nRule Changes This section gives you the scope to modify the rules of normal rugby league to help teach what you want to teach. This could include rules like if you carry the ball in one hand it’s a turnover or you may not have any markers in defence. Think creatively to come up with rules that help you to teach your outcomes.\\n\\nWhere and how is the game started? If your game is based around opposed work and not individual skills then you need to identify what situation they are in. What area of the field are they in? Are they attacking or defending? Is it tackle 1 or tackle 4 that they start at? The game can also start from lines, behind cones or a play the ball\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\n78\\n\\nStrategies to Increase Learning in Skill Biased Games\\n\\nGame Sense Game sense is a relatively new approach to teaching and coaching which uses games as the focus of the session. By focusing on the game players will better communicate and become tactically aware to make better decisions during the game. This is all done whilst developing the skills of the game in a realistic context. The way that players learn in a game sense approach is for a coach to use questioning skills to assist players to solve problems rather than tell players what is right or wrong. If the phrasing of the questions is effective it will help “guide” the players to the right answer. The right type of questions to use are open questions, which are questions that promote discussion and interaction rather than yes or no answers. Examples of grate open questions could be:\\n\\nWhere is the best place to run the ball and why? Which is the best person to pass to & why? How can you make it more difficult for your opponent to score? When is the best time in a game to attack? Is it better to pass or run in that situation?\\n\\nHow can you assist your teammate?\\n\\nIf you can get the players to answer these questions with your guidance then they are much more likely to retain the information. It will also help your players learn exactly what you are trying to teach them.\\n\\nPenalty / Reward System When you are teaching a team or individual to perform an aspect of the game, you must have a penalty or reward system so that players learn what is good and bad. A penalty system means that if you don’t do what is required in the game then you penalized. Just like in rugby league. The penalty must be immediate rather than built up at the end of a session so that players understand exactly why they are penalized. A reward system is the same concept, you are just rewarding them when they display behaviour that you want them to. Examples of both penalties and rewards are displayed below.\\n\\nPENALTIES\\n\\nREWARDS\\n\\nChangeover of possession Loose a tackle from the tackle count Loose points for your team Loose a player for a determined\\n\\nGain possession of the ball\\n\\nGain extra tackle’s in the tackle count\\n\\nGain points for your team\\n\\namount of time.\\n\\nGain extra players.\\n\\nNRL Coach Education\\n\\nSeries Number 1\\n\\n79\\n\\nSBG1 Two Hand Carry\\n\\nAny Age\\n\\n10 mins\\n\\nMin. 6 Players\\n\\nGame Objectives / Outcomes: for all players to learn to run with the ball in two hands when\\n\\nSkill Area(s): Catch & Pass, Carry, Attacking Play\\n\\nDrill Description: Normal of game of touch Rugby League applies.

By setting up and using the key words during feedback, coaches can quickly correct a movement/ skill performance with the use of one word or phrase which acts as the summary of the teaching point.\\n\\nEXPLANATION > This stage involves explaining the main teaching points of the\\n\\nskill to the participants�\\n\\n> Only the main points need to be explained, too much information\\n\\ncan be confusing�\\n\\n> The use of key words is important at this stage�\\n\\nPRACTICE > Players perform the skill� > Ensure that the activity/drill being used to perform the skill is\\n\\nallowing the players to perform it correctly�\\n\\nConcurrent Feedback:\\n\\n> Allow the players time to practice and develop confidence before\\n\\nConcurrent feedback occurs when the coach provides the feedback to the players while the players are actually performing the skill.

Players play a one-on-one try scoring game, with the aim of scoring a try past a single defender.\\n\\n2. Introduce a second attacker to the game (two- on-one).\\n\\nWhat is Game Sense? Game Sense is an approach to coaching which involves the use of games to develop an understanding of tactics and game concepts, while enabling the performance of skills in a realistic environment�\\n\\nGame Sense makes a game the focus of a practice session rather than technique� It challenges the players to think about what they are actually doing and why� The coach/teacher becomes a facilitator, setting tasks to be solved and creating situations where players take on the responsibility of finding solutions for themselves�\\n\\n3. Introduce a second defender (two-on-two).\\n\\n4. Increase the number of chances that a team has to score.\\n\\n5. Introduce a third attacker into the game.\\n\\nWhy use Game Sense? Traditionally, we have taught skills to young players in isolation, and have not always considered the tactical components of the skill (knowing when and where to actually use the skill or what changes need to be made to the skill during the game to make it effective)�\\n\\n6. Introduce a third defender into the game.\\n\\n7. Make the players ‘play- the-ball’ following each of their chances in the game.\\n\\n8. Continue to introduce players and chances to score.\\n\\nGame Sense coaching focuses on the performance of skills in game situations and allows players to develop tactical and strategic thinking, decision making, problem solving through tactical awareness and understanding�\\n\\nWhile there is an important place for technical coaching and skill development, the Game Sense method encourages players to use their basic skills as well as develop strategies or tactics themselves�\\n\\nHow to use Game Sense? Game sense involves the principle of moving from simple challenges in games to progressively more complex ones� This progression can involve the movement from a relatively structured environment to a more open one�\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nFEW RULES\\n\\nMANY RULES\\n\\nONE OPPONENT\\n\\nMORE THAN ONE OPPONENT\\n\\nONE TEAM MATE\\n\\nMORE THAN ONE TEAM MATE\\n\\n(Reference: Australian Sport Commission, 1999, ‘Game Sense Cards: 30 games to develop thinking players’.)\\n\\n108\\n\\nHow You Coach\\n\\nProper Planning:\\n\\nProper planning is the key to ensuring that your players have a positive and effective learning experience at every training session. Planning will enable coaches to consider the use of each of the ‘Principles for Better Practice’ in each session\\n\\nMake the practice game-specific and use the Game Sense approach frequently > Games are enjoyable for the participants and the learning\\n\\ntransfers well to the player’s performance in matches�\\n\\nKeep practices short and frequent > Variety in activity will assist in maintaining the player’s interest level and will improve their learning as well as the sessions more fun�\\n\\nPlayer Involvement:\\n\\nCoaches should aim to have all players involved throughout the session. Maximum player involvement enhances player interest and enjoyment and ensures that ALL players are enjoying the experience.\\n\\nMake maximum use of equipment, facilities and assistants > The less time that players spend waiting around, the more time they get to participate and learn� This will make your sessions more fun and allow the players to get the maximum benefits of both learning and physical activity�\\n\\n> Coaches should aim to have maximum player involvement in all\\n\\nactivities�\\n\\nProvide proper feedback and correction > Coaches must not forget their role of providing proper corrective feedback during all skill practice� This will ensure that players continue to improve their skills at every session�\\n\\n> Feedback must be considered and planned� Coaches should not rush into providing feedback until they have thought about the message and how they plan to deliver it�\\n\\nMake sure that the players achieve reasonable success at every session >\\n\\nIt is important that all players leave each session having felt that they have achieved and improved� Coaches can ensure that this occurs through providing appropriate positive feedback and planning sessions so that players complete each session on a successful note�\\n\\n109\\n\\nProviding Proper Feedback\\n\\nReflective Questioning:\\n\\nFeedback to your players must be:\\n\\nBy asking questions to players about their performance, coaches can achieve better results from feedback than would have been achieved by simply telling the players what they need to do to improve.\\n\\n1. Specific and concise Make sure that your feedback is specific and accurate and does not include too much general information� Feedback is best when it only concentrates on a few small points of a skill performance rather than the skill performance as a whole�\\n\\nTiming of Feedback:\\n\\nCoaches need to allow players to make mistakes and to learn from their own mistakes. To allow this process to happen, coaches should not be too willing to ‘rescue’ their players by providing feedback immediately following every mistake. If there is no immediate danger to the players (for instance: if a tackling technique is incorrect) coaches are encouraged to allow players to identify and correct some of their own errors. Feedback can then be used if the errors become consistent.\\n\\n2. Positive and immediate It is beneficial if your feedback occurs immediately after a skill performance� This will allow players to consider your feedback while the performance is fresh in their memory� Positive feedback is important to build and maintain the confidence of your players�\\n\\n3. Constructive (performance-based) Feedback must be concentrated on areas of performance that players can physically improve in their next performance� Constructive feedback needs to concentrate on areas like movement and positioning during skill performances�\\n\\n4. Individual and/or group Feedback can be provided to both individuals and groups and can be based on both individual and group performances� It is often beneficial to provide positive feedback to the group and individual corrective feedback directly to individual players�\\n\\n5. Offering remedial solutions Feedback must offer corrections rather than criticisms� Feedback should be used to encourage and correct performance and therefore the players must be able to physically act upon your feedback to improve their performance�\\n\\n6. Encouraging self-assessment/reflection Coaches are encouraged to use questioning as a method of enabling players to improve their performance� Rather than telling the players what to do, coaches are encouraged to ask the players about their performances and work together to develop corrective actions�\\n\\n110\\n\\nMaintaining a Safe Environment\\n\\nDuty of Care\\n\\nDuty of Care:\\n\\nAn obligation that a sensible person would have in the circumstances when acting toward others and the public. The actions of a coach should be made with care, attention, caution, and prudence.\\n\\nCoaches have a duty of care to the health and safety of their players� By ensuring that the following statements are implemented, coaches will be able to maintain the safety of their players at both training and in matches�\\n\\n1. Provide a safe environment\\n\\n2. Plan activities adequately\\n\\n3. Evaluate any injury or incapacity\\n\\n4. Do not mismatch players\\n\\nKeep Adequate Records:\\n\\n5. Provide safe and proper equipment\\n\\nAs part of a coach’s duty of care, all coaches must keep adequate records of any injuries/incidents that occur at both training sessions and matches. This resource will assist coaches to fulfill this obligation.\\n\\n6. Warn of inherent risk\\n\\n7. Supervise well\\n\\n8. Know first aid\\n\\n9. Develop clear rules for training and general behavior\\n\\n10. Keep adequate records\\n\\nThis resource is an important tool in maintaining a safe training and playing environment� Coaches are encouraged to use this resource to:\\n\\n> Record player details and medical information�\\n\\n> Seek permission from parents to administer injury/illness management in consultation with qualified First Aid Officer�\\n\\n> Plan training sessions and match days�\\n\\n> Review training sessions and match day activities�\\n\\nUsing this resource to consistently plan and review coaching activities throughout the season enables coaches to regularly evaluate their coaching activities against the statements above.\\n\\n111\\n\\nBasic First Aid Procedures\\n\\nNRL On-Field Policy:\\n\\nThe National Rugby League On-Field Policy States that:\\n\\n1. All official personnel over the age of fourteen (14) years who enter the Field of Play to attend a player, must possess a ‘LeagueSafe Certificate of Attendance’ or an accredited NRL Sports Trainers certificate of attainment\\n\\n2. No person other than an accredited NRL Sports Trainer, or those with appropriate and acceptable qualifications, shall administer first aid or offer advice to an injured/ill player. Personnel with other qualifications must be ratified by the National Education, Training & Research Manager and equate with NRL Sports Trainer Certification.\\n\\nThe notes below are to provide a reference point for coaches and in no way replace the knowledge gained through the completion of National Rugby League’s accredited LeagueSafe and Sports Trainer Courses. It is encouraged that all coaches have a Leaguesafe or Sports Trainer accreditation.\\n\\nWhen you attend the scene of an incident/injury, follow the DRSABCD action plan:\\n\\nDANGER\\n\\nCheck for Danger: > To yourself > To others/bystanders > To the casualty\\n\\nRESPONSE\\n\\nCheck for a Response: >\\n\\nIs the casualty conscious or unconscious?\\n\\nSEND FOR HELP Call triple zero (000) for an ambulance\\n\\n> Or ask another person to make the call\\n\\n3.

The accredited Sports Trainer shall at all times, whilst a game is in progress, be situated on the sideline in a position to respond quickly should an injury/illness occur.\\n\\n5. The accredited Sports Trainer shall have the final say on whether a player should continue in the game and when to resume playing in that game. If a doctor is in attendance at a game venue, he/she shall make decisions in conjunction with the Sports Trainer. The doctor will make the final decision on a player’s welfare. In the event of a serious injury, as defined by the Sports Trainer, a doctor’s certificate must be obtained by the player and handed to the Sports Trainer prior to the player resuming playing.\\n\\nTALK\\n\\nOBSERVE\\n\\nTOUCH\\n\\nAsk the injured player: > How did it happen? > Where does it hurt? > How did you land? Twisted/straight? > Did you hear or feel clicking, locking, grating,\\n\\nsnap, rip, tear or giving way?\\n\\n> What kind of pain? Throbbing, burning, searing pain? Pins and needles? Toothache pain?\\n\\n> Ask any other questions relevant to the players\\n\\nsuspected condition�\\n\\nLook for the following: > Bones: alignment, deformity or unusual shape� > Soft tissue: contours shape, comparing both sides� > Note any swelling� > Colour: redness, inflammation, pale or bluish\\n\\ncolour�\\n\\nThis should only occur after the above has been completed� > Be gentle and consider player comfort� > Do not drag the player to his/her feet� > > Start away from the injured site and work\\n\\nIs it tender to touch?\\n\\ntowards and beyond�\\n\\n> What is the extent of the painful area? > Try to locate the exact site and relate it to a\\n\\nparticular anatomical structure�\\n\\nACTIVE-MOVEMENT\\n\\n> Ask the player to move the injured limb until\\n\\nrestricted by pain�\\n\\n> Significant restriction indicates possible serious\\n\\ninjury�\\n\\nPASSIVE-MOVEMENT\\n\\n> You, as the examiner, gently move the injured\\n\\narea to the point of pain or restriction�\\n\\n> Return to play should not be considered unless pain free full range of movement is evident�\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\n> Ask player to stand unaided > Ask him/her to walk, jog and carry out specific\\n\\nskills related to the injured part�\\n\\n> Return to play if pain free\\n\\n113\\n\\nNRL On-Field Policy:\\n\\nManagement of Injuries (R.I.C.E.R. Management Cycle)\\n\\n(CONTINUED)\\n\\n6. An accredited NRL Sports Trainer will be attached to a team. It is advisable that at least two (2) be available in case one is required to attend a player or not be available on game day.\\n\\n7. It will be the responsibility of the Club and/or Ground Officials to ensure the above policy is adhered to.\\n\\nREST: Withdraw from the game Continued activity increases the severity of the injury� Rest reduces the volume and pressure of blood through the damaged vessels to the injured area�\\n\\nICE: Apply ice to the injury Ice reduces bleeding by slowing down the blood flow to the injured area, thus reducing swelling� Ice must be applied as soon as possible after injury� Application: Apply regularly for 10-15 minutes, for first 24-72 hours\\n\\n8. If the above personnel are not in attendance, the game shall not commence UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES until such persons are available.\\n\\n9. Each player shall complete a Medical Advice Card before training or playing. This will be the responsibility of the designated Sports Trainer(s) to ensure all cards are up to date. All privacy laws must be adhered to.\\n\\nCOMPRESSION: Apply a compression bandage Most effective method of controlling bleeding� Should be applied during and after icing� Use a stretch bandage above and below the injured area� Apply from beyond the injury upwards (towards the heart) and from inside to outside� Must be continued after icing�\\n\\nELEVATION: Elevate the injured area above the heart where practical Elevation assists in: Reducing the pressure through the injured limb and reducing blood pooling\\n\\nFor full policy refer to playnrl.com/policies\\n\\nREFERRAL: Refer the player to appropriate medical personnel At all times refer the player to appropriate medical personnel� Correct an immediate management is essential for a quick recovery�\\n\\nThere are certain practices that should not\\n\\nbe undertaken in the acute stages of injury management to a soft tissue injury:\\n\\nHEAT: Application of any form of heat will dramatically increase bleeding�\\n\\nALCOHOL: Consumption of alcohol dilutes the blood vessels thus increasing blood flow, swelling and pain�\\n\\nRETURNING TO PLAY: Returning to play with a soft tissue injury will result in delayed healing, or an increase in the severity of the injury�\\n\\nMASSAGE: Massaging an acute soft tissue injury will increase bleeding or may re-start bleeding�\\n\\n114\\n\\nHead Injury & Concussion\\n\\nAn ambulance should be called if it is suspected that a player has suffered a concussion.\\n\\nThe doctor is the only person who will determine when a player is allowed to return to training or playing following a concussion.\\n\\nA player should never return to a sports activity until they are cleared by a doctor.\\n\\nWhat is a concussion? A concussion is an injury to the brain� A blow to the head usually causes it� Most of the time it doesn’t involve loss of consciousness�\\n\\nWhat are the signs of a concussion? > Headache > Dizziness > Confusion > Ringing ears > Nausea\\n\\n> Vision disturbance > Loss of balance > Memory loss (amnesia) > Difficulty concentrating\\n\\nWhat should I watch out for? > Stiff neck > Severe headache > Repeated vomiting > Confusion > Difficulty walking, speaking or using arms > Numbness/tingling or altered sensations to extremities > Seizures/convulsions > Unusual drowsiness or hard to wake up\\n\\nWhen can a player return to play? A player should never return to play while they have any signs of a concussion like headache or dizziness� If the concussion was very mild, the player may be allowed to return, but only on the advice of a doctor�\\n\\nIf the player had a loss of consciousness or memory, they may not be able return to play for a number of weeks� After a severe concussion, a player may not be able to return to play for a month� If this wasn’t the player’s first concussion, the return to play may be even longer�\\n\\nWhat are the risks in returning to play too early? A player returning to play too early from a head injury risks suffering from a number of complications such as ‘cerebral contusion’ (a bruising of the brain tissue) or a ‘cerebral haemorrhage’ (bleeding of the blood vessels in the brain), both of which MAY BE FATAL�\\n\\nAre there any lasting effects to a concussion? Most people recover after a concussion without any permanent damage though people can have signs of concussion for weeks or even months afterwards� Repeated concussions can cause permanent damage� After several concussions a doctor may speak to a player about alternative options to contact sports�\\n\\n115\\n\\nThe Management of Concussion In Rugby League\\n\\nFor Trainers, First-Aid Providers, coaches and parents\\n\\nThese Guidelines are based on the Consensus Statement produced following the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Berlin in October 2016. The Guidelines should be followed at all times and any decision regarding return to play after concussive injuries should only be made by a doctor, preferably with experience in dealing with such injuries.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThe most important element in the management of concussion MUST ALWAYS be the welfare of the player - in both the short and long term.\\n\\nConcussion is a disturbance in brain function resulting from trauma that is transmitted to the brain either directly or indirectly. There is no absolute need for direct head impact for a concussion to occur. There are no structural changes and the changes that do occur are temporary and should recover spontaneously if managed appropriately.\\n\\nComplications can occur if the player is allowed to continue playing before they have fully recovered from the concussion. Therefore, a player who is suspected of having a concussion must be taken out of the game or training session immediately. Such a player should not be returned to play in the same game, even if they appear to have recovered. Concussion is an evolving condition over minutes to hours (and sometimes days). Some symptoms/signs may resolve only to be replaced by others later.\\n\\nThe management of head injuries may be difficult for non-medical personnel. It is often not clear whether you are dealing with concussion, or there is a more severe structural head injury, especially in the early phases of the injury. Concussion is considered a medical condition and therefore needs to be assessed and managed by a medical professional.\\n\\nIt is therefore imperative that ALL players with concussion, or suspected of having a concussion, need URGENT medical assessment.\\n\\nIn the period following a concussion, a player should not be allowed to return to play or train until they have had a formal medical clearance by a doctor.\\n\\nImportant points in the management of concussion include:\\n\\n» Suspecting the diagnosis in a player with symptoms such as confusion or headache after an apparent head injury (direct or indirect knock to the head)\\n\\n116\\n\\n» Referral of the player for medical evaluation » The player must have medical clearance by a doctor before being\\n\\nallowed to return to a graded training program.\\n\\n» The player must have a further medical clearance by a doctor before\\n\\nbeing allowed to return to contact training and matches.\\n\\nPlayers suspected of having a concussion must not be allowed to drive, operate machinery, drink alcohol, take anti-inflammatory medication (including aspirin and Ibuprofen), or use strong painkillers or sleeping tablets until they have been medically cleared to do so by a doctor.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nWhen considering the management of concussion, the welfare of the player - both in the short and long term - MUST always remain paramount.\\n\\nSince 2001, there have been five international conferences addressing the key issues in the understanding and management of concussion. After each meeting, a summary has been published to improve the safety and health of athletes who suffer concussive injuries during participation in sport”. The most recently in October 2016. The summary from the Berlin meeting provides guidelines for current best practice management of concussion(1). The NRL’s current guidelines for the management of concussion are based on the Berlin conference, as well as research conducted on concussion in NRL, World Rugby and AFL over a number of years.\\n\\npublished\\n\\nconference\\n\\nwas\\n\\nheld\\n\\nin\\n\\nBerlin\\n\\nWhat is Concussion?\\n\\n“Traumatic Brain Injury” (TBI) is the term used to describe injuries to the brain that are caused by trauma. The most severe injuries involve structural damage e.g. fractures of the skull, bleeding in or around the brain. These structural injuries require urgent medical attention.\\n\\nConcussion falls into the milder spectrum of TBI (mTBI = mild traumatic brain injury) and involves a disturbance of brain function with no structural damage or probable permanent injury to the brain.\\n\\nConcussion is caused by trauma to the brain, which can be either direct contact with the head (e.g. head clash) or indirect by a force to any part of the body transmitted to the head (e.g. shoulder charge or tackle). When the force is transmitted to the brain it can “stun” the nerve tissue and affect the way the nerves work. This can result in a number of symptoms and signs depending on the area of brain that is affected. Concussions, therefore, present in many different ways and the symptoms and signs often change or evolve over time.\\n\\nSymptoms include headache, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, poor balance, fatigue and feeling “not quite right”. A concussed player may also exhibit confusion, memory loss and reduced ability to think clearly and process\\n\\n117\\n\\ninformation. Loss of consciousness is not common and occurs in less than 10% of cases of concussion. It is important to understand that a player does not have to lose consciousness to have concussion.\\n\\nThe essential injury in concussion is functional disturbance rather than structural damage. The changes that occur are temporary and usually recover spontaneously if managed correctly. The recovery period and process varies from person to person and injury to injury. Most cases of concussion in Rugby League recover within 7-14 days from the time of injury, although in a small number of cases the recovery time may be weeks to months. Children and adolescents (18 years old and younger) may take longer to recover.\\n\\nHow common is concussion in Rugby League?\\n\\nConcussion is relatively common in Rugby League. In the past 4-5 years the incidence in the NRL’s elite competition has been 5-7 concussions per team per season.\\n\\nWhat are the potential complications following concussion?\\n\\nThe complications which can possibly occur following a concussion include:\\n\\n» Increased risk of other musculoskeletal injury (possibly due to\\n\\nreduction in reaction time) or repeated concussion (with the second injury often much more severe than the first);\\n\\n» Prolonged symptoms; » Symptoms of depression, anxiety and other psychological problems; » Severe brain swelling (especially in young players); and » Potentially long-term brain malfunction (not currently proven).\\n\\nComplications are not common, however, the risk of complications is increased by allowing the player to return to play (or training) before they have recovered completely. It is therefore essential to recognise a possible concussion, make the diagnosis, and keep the player out of training and competition until the player has recovered completely.\\n\\nConcussion can cause problems with memory and processing of information, which interferes with the player’s ability to learn in the classroom, therefore, a child should not return to school until cleared by a medical practitioner to do so. A successful return to school should occur before attempting a return to training/sport.\\n\\n118\\n\\nSteps in the Management of Concussion\\n\\nNOTE: Any player with a loss of consciousness, basic first aid principles should be applied i.e. Danger, Response, Send for help, Airway, Breathing, Circulation and +/- CPR (DRSABC). Care must always be taken with the player’s neck, as it may have also been injured in the collision. An ambulance should be called and the player(s) transported to hospital for assessment and management.\\n\\n119\\n\\nGame Day Management\\n\\nThe most important steps in the early management of concussion include:\\n\\n1. Recognising the injury; 2. Removing the player from the game; and 3. Referring the player to a medical practitioner (doctor) for assessment.\\n\\n1. Visible Clues - when to suspect concussion: Recognising the injury – (making the diagnosis)\\n\\nLoss of consciousness or non-responsive\\n\\nLying on the ground - not moving, or slow to stand\\n\\nUnsteady on feet / balance problems / poor coordination\\n\\nGrabbing / clutching at head\\n\\nDazed, blank or vacant look\\n\\nConfused / not aware of plays or events\\n\\n2. Loss of consciousness, confusion and disturbance of memory are classical features of concussion, but it is important to remember that they are not present in every case.\\n\\n3. There are several non-specific symptoms that may be present and which should raise the suspicion of concussion: headache, blurred vision, balance problems, dizziness, feeling “dazed” or “light headed”, “don’t feel right”, drowsiness, fatigue and difficulty concentrating.\\n\\n4. Tools such as the pocket Concussion Recognition Tool 5 (see attachment) can be used to help make the diagnosis of concussion.\\n\\nhttp://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/early/2017/04/26/bjsports- 2017-097508CRT5.full.pdf\\n\\n5. It is important to understand that brief sideline evaluation tools (such as Concussion Recognition Tool 5 and SCAT5) are designed to help make the diagnosis of concussion. It is still imperative to arrange a more comprehensive medical assessment by an appropriately experienced medical practitioner. The SCAT5 is a medical practitioner (doctor) only assessment tool.\\n\\n1. Initial management must always follow first aid rules, including airway, breathing, circulation and spinal immobilisation.\\n\\nRemoving the player from the game\\n\\n2. Any player who is suspected of having a concussion must be removed from the game and be assessed by the first aider (Sports Trainer).\\n\\n3. A player who has suffered a concussion (or suspected concussion) must not be allowed to return to play in the same game. The assessor should not be swayed by the opinion of the player, coaching staff or anyone else\\n\\n120\\n\\nsuggesting premature return to play. Concussion is an evolving condition and symptoms and signs can vary over minutes to hours and days.\\n\\n1. The management of a head injury is difficult for non-medical personnel. Following an injury it is often not clear if you are dealing with a concussion or with a more severe underlying structural head injury;\\n\\nReferring the player to a medical practitioner for assessment\\n\\n2. ALL players with concussion - or a suspected concussion - need an URGENT medical assessment by a medical practitioner. This can be done by a doctor present at the venue (if available) or local general practice or medical centre or hospital emergency department;\\n\\n3. It is useful to have a list of local doctors, (who are willing to see injured players) and emergency departments close to the ground where the game is to be played;\\n\\n4. A pre-game checklist of the appropriate services;\\n\\n5. Local Doctors or medical centres;\\n\\n6. Local Hospital Emergency Departments; and\\n\\n7. Ambulance Services (000).\\n\\n1. First Aid principles of DRSABC (+/- CPR) should be used. It is extremely important to treat all unconscious players as though they also have a neck injury (Spinal Immobilisation).\\n\\nManagement of an unconscious player\\n\\n2. An unconscious player must only be moved (onto a stretcher) by immobilisation qualified health professionals, techniques. If no qualified person is present, do not move the player - wait for the ambulance and paramedics. trained\\n\\n3. Urgent hospital referral is necessary if there is concern regarding the risk of a serious or structural head or neck injury --- ring 000.\\n\\n4. Any player with ANY of the following in the context of a possible head injury should be referred to a hospital urgently, via Ambulance:\\n\\nLoss of consciousness\\n\\nSeizures / fits or convulsions\\n\\nSevere or increasing headache\\n\\nDouble vision\\n\\nVomiting\\n\\nDeterioration of conscious state after being injured, e.g. increased drowsiness\\n\\nReport of neck pain / tenderness\\n\\n121\\n\\nBurning, numbness, tingling or weakness in arms/legs. (potential spinal cord symptoms)\\n\\n\\n\\nIncreasingly restless, agitated or combative\\n\\nIf, at any time, there is any doubt, the player should be referred to hospital.\\n\\nFollow-up Management\\n\\nA player who has sustained a concussion MUST NOT be allowed to return to school or play before getting a medical clearance;\\n\\nReturn to learning and school should take precedence over return to sport;\\n\\nThe decision regarding the timing of return to training should always be\\n\\n\\n\\nmade by a medical practitioner (doctor); In cases of uncertainty about the player’s recovery, always adopt a more conservative approach, “if in doubt sit them out”.\\n\\nReturn to Play/Sport\\n\\nPlayers should not return to play until they have returned to school/\\n\\nlearning without worsening symptoms; • Return to training/ play should be gradual; • Rehabilitation after a concussion should be supervised by a medical practitioner and should follow stepwise symptom limited progression. Initially, complete rest for the first 24 to 48 hours – including mental and physical rest (recovery), should be adhered to. Children and adolescents should be treated more conservatively, so 48 hours rest is recommended;\\n\\n\\n\\nA 6 stage Graded Return To Sport (GRTS) Program can look like the following (it can be commenced after the initial rest period of 24 to 48 hours):\\n\\n1. Symptom-limited activity – Daily activities that do not provoke or worsen symptoms:\\n\\n2. Light Aerobic Exercise – e.g., walk, exercise bike with Heart Rate less than ~70% max (no resistance/weight training);\\n\\n3. Sport Specific Exercise – e.g. running drills without risk of head contact;\\n\\n4. Non-contact training and start resistance (weight) training; 5. Full contact training – ONLY after medical clearance by a doctor – coaching staff should assess tackling technique and other skills;\\n\\n6. Return to play/games.\\n\\nEach stage should be a minimum of 24 hours’ duration, meaning a period of 7 to 8 days as a minimum time frame to return to full contact sport in the community level of the game is recommended. Longer time\\n\\n122\\n\\nframes are suggested in children and adolescents 18 years old and younger.\\n\\nIf symptoms return, then the player should drop back to the previous symptom- free stage once symptoms have resolved. Player honesty is important when questioning about symptoms. Remember that playing or training with symptoms of concussion can increase the risk of injury, result in concussion complications and prolonged symptoms, result in reduced performance, increase the risk of other injuries (musculoskeletal) and could potentially be catastrophic.\\n\\nChildren and adolescents (18 years old and younger)\\n\\nThe same principles regarding recognition/detection, management and return to sport apply to children and adolescents, however, it is widely accepted that children and adolescents with concussion should be managed more conservatively. This includes longer initial rest and slower return to train and play programs. Additionally, a successful symptom-free return to school/learn should be completed before a graded return to play/train is commenced.\\n\\nReference:\\n\\n1 McCrory P, Meeuwisse W, Dvorak Jet al. Consensus statement on concussion in sport - the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Berlin, October 2016. Br J Sports Medicine . 2017;51:838-847.\\n\\nDate: 23rd November 2017\\n\\n123\\n\\nNational Rugby League Policy RETURN TO PLAY\\n\\nAt times, a variety of injuries/illness occurs while playing contact sports. It is inevitable that injuries and illness will occur during a player/s career whether it is through professional or social events.\\n\\nRugby League is a contact sport. The NRL Accredited Sports Trainer Code of Practice recognises that injuries occur on a variety of levels from minor muscular related, sprains, strains to fractures to more serious injuries such as head and spinal injuries and on some very rare occasions, death.\\n\\nThe cause of these injuries and conditions can range from a social nature to a physiological nature such as age and weight to a physical nature such as decreased physical condition, pre-existing conditions and injuries to name a few.\\n\\nThe aim of this Code of Practice is to give Sports Trainers at a club level, the tools that they need to assess an injured player/s and to recognise if it is safe to allow a player/s to return to the field of play or to instruct the player/s coach, other on field staff and parents of the player/s ability or inability to return to the field of play.\\n\\nInjuries that are not managed appropriately can cause the player/s further pain and discomfort. On the other hand, if a player/s has returned to the field of play too early without proper injury management and advice, this can lead to a serious injury or worse.\\n\\nAs a Sports Trainer, it is expected that you operate in accordance with your qualification and if in doubt, seek further assistance from higher qualified officers such as Level 2 Sports Trainers, relevant ambulance services (call them to the field to assess the player/s) or doctors who are present at the game.\\n\\nNEVER ALLOW A PLAYER/S TO RETURN TO THE FIELD OF PLAY IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT OF FURTHER INJURY. Remember that all relevant injury paperwork needs to be completed for all players who are assisted from the field by a Sports Trainer and are managed by a Sports Trainer.\\n\\nOnce a decision has been made for a player/s not to return to the field of play, the player/s will not return to training or play any further games until medical clearance is made by a doctor and paperwork has been filed with the Club’s Co-ordinator.\\n\\n124\\n\\nNRL Sports Trainer Accreditation Scheme\\n\\nNational Rugby League Policy RETURN TO PLAY\\n\\nConditions where a medical clearance is required\\n\\n» Any form of cardiac (heart condition) » Hypertension (history of high blood pressure) » Broken bones of any sort (other than fingers) » Significant soft tissue injuries (where a player has not recovered to a playing capacity\\n\\none week post insult) » Any form of concussion » Any form of unconsciousness, no matter how brief » Any form of potential cervical (neck) injury » Repeated episodes of illness of already diagnosed medical conditions such as » Asthma, diabetes and epilepsy » Any injury involving the eye itself » Any player recovering from a significant illness, such as:\\n\\nChicken Pox\\n\\nMeasles\\n\\nWhooping cough\\n\\nGlandular fever\\n\\nSwine flu (H1/N1)\\n\\nPneumonia\\n\\nAny form of influenza where it has caused the player to miss games and training greater than one week\\n\\nAny immune depressed conditions as deemed necessary by accredited Sports Trainers\\n\\nThe above points are not completely exhaustive, however it is expected that a common sense approach is applied by Sports Trainers when requesting a medical clearance. Many of the mentioned conditions can be exacerbated (made worse) by physical activity and cause the player/s further illness or discomfort. Some medical conditions can also be contagious and pose a risk to other players and coaching staff. Player welfare is the number one priority of the Rugby League Sports Trainers’ Accreditation Scheme. The reason for medical clearances is not all about liability. It is ensuring that players seek medical attention for conditions that may cause them further serious health problems in the long term.\\n\\nNRL Sports Trainer Accreditation Scheme\\n\\n125\\n\\nNational Rugby League Policy RETURN TO PLAY\\n\\nRETURN TO PLAY\\n\\nSome injuries during a game and training resolve, such as where a player gets “tagged”, receives grazes / abrasions and some superficial lacerations, many of which can be managed quite promptly by the accredited Sports Trainer.\\n\\nSome soft tissue and joint injuries can be managed quite appropriately by strapping with no further complications arising. With any injury in which ICE has been applied, it is imperative that the joint/muscle is adequately re-warmed to the players’ original pre injury conditions and that there is no impairment to the players’ range of movement and/or sensation. The accredited Sports Trainer can cause any exercise, fitness test or stretching task to be completed by any player/s before they are allowed to return to the field of play.\\n\\nThe return to play will be at the discretion of the accredited Sports Trainer as noted in numerous National Rugby League documentation i.e. the On Field Policy.\\n\\nTHE ACCREDITED NATIONAL RUGBY LEAGUE SPORTS TRAINER WILL HAVE THE LAST SAY IN PLAYER WELFARE.\\n\\nIt is expected that the accredited Sports Trainer will work closely with the coaching staff to ensure that player welfare is and will always remain paramount in the game of Rugby League.\\n\\n126\\n\\nNRL Sports Trainer Accreditation Scheme\\n\\nNational SafePlay Code\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe Safeplay Code was developed to emphasise safety and good conduct within the game of Rugby League by creating the best possible on-field environment and actively encouraging the core values of Rugby League, and a healthy respect for all participants.
